# Optimizing PV Grid Integration: A Data-Driven Approach to Curtailment and Compensation

## Challenge Description
### Guiding Question for Ideation:
How might we develop a reliable methodology to estimate PV curtailment losses and enable fair compensation models for different grid scenarios?

## Who Has the Problem:
CKW Grids Division

## What Is the Problem:
The steady increase in PV feed-in poses major challenges for the CKW grids. Personnel costs and investments for grid reinforcements have multiplied in recent years. The limitation of feed-in peaks will be made possible with the new StromVV as of 2026. 3% of annual energy production will be available to the grid operator free of charge for grid-related purposes. The VSE's industry recommendation, which has not yet been published, recommends implementing this by means of a fixed feed-in limit of 70% or 80% depending on the height above sea level. This specification can lead to yield losses of > 3% in individual cases. We therefore need a tool to estimate/calculate the effective yield losses. A calculation is only possible for systems which, in addition to the exchange measurement with the grid, also have a production measurement with which the self-consumption can be determined. For a large proportion of systems (<30 kW) there is no production measurement. In these cases, the yield loss can therefore only be estimated. Here we need a methodology to estimate self-consumption.

In a further step, it will be necessary to limit the feed-in to significantly less than 70% of the peak output (e.g. 40%). With the new legislation, we can offer this to customers as an optional tariff. Here, too, the expected losses must be precisely determined so that an appropriate tariff structure can be created.

In a final step, real-time signals (e.g. dynamic grid bonus) control the feed-in. In this case, it must also be possible to determine the yield losses.

## Why Is It Important:
The feed-in limitation helps us to better utilize the operating resources and not to focus the grid on the few hours in which high outputs occur. The energy generated during these hours is already frequently priced negatively on the spot market. A prerequisite for the utilization of this flexibility potential is a methodology for calculating/estimating actual yield losses for the cases described above.

## Desired Outcome of the Challenge:
Methodology to estimate the PV production to develop financial and technical compensation models for different grid scenarios. The methodology should also be majority-capable.

## Skills Needed:
A diverse background within the team is preferred; especially technical, mathematical and economical knowledge would support us as well as various businesses & market roles. An emphasis is on forecasting the PV production.
